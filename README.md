# Support vector machine analysis on Anorexia Data on Weight Change

logistic regresion and support vector classifier often share similar results.
When the classes are well separated, SVMs tend to behave better than logistic regression.
In more overlapping situation, logisitc regression is better.

The support vector classifier (subset of SVM) is for classification in the two-class setting
if the boundary is kinda linear. SVM extends the support vector classifier using kernels.
